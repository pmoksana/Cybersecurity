## **Objectives** 

**Part 1: Add a New Group for Users** 

**Part 2: Add Users to the New Group** 

**Part 3: Switch Users and Modify Permissions** 

**Part 4: Modify Permissions in Absolute Mode** 

## **Background / Scenario** 

In this lab, you will use the Linux command line to create a group for new users and add users to the group. Each user will be assigned a password for authenticating at login. Then you will modify permissions to authorize read, write, and execute privileges for both users and groups. 

## **Required Resources** 

PC with the **CSE-LABVM** installed in VirtualBox 

## **Instructions** 

## **Part 1: Add a New Group for Users** 

In this part, you will add a new group for users to the virtual machine. 

## **Step 1: Open a terminal window in the CSE-LABVM.** 

- a. Launch the **CSE-LABVM** . 

- b. Double-click the **Terminal** icon to open a terminal. 

## **Step 2: Escalate privileges to the root level.** 

Enter the **sudo su** command and enter **password** as the password when prompted. 

`cisco@labvm:~$` **`sudo su`** `[sudo] password for cisco: root@labvm:/home/cisco#` 

## **Step 3: Add a new group named HR.** 

Enter the **groupadd HR** command. 

`root@ubuntu:/home/cisco#` **`groupadd HR`** 

## **Step 4: Verify the new group has been added.** 

Enter the **cat /etc/group** command to verify that HR was added. 

`root@labvm:/home/cisco#` **`cat /etc/group`**

## **Part 3: Switch Users and Modify Permissions** 

In this part, you will login as jenny, explore directories, and change permissions. 

## **Step 1: Switch user from root to jenny.** 

- a. To switch to Jenny's desktop, click **Menu** at the bottom left of the desktop, and then click **Logout** . 

- b. Click **Switch User** from the dialog box. 

- c. Click **Jenny** from the list of available users and enter the password **jenPass** . 

- d. Jenny's desktop loads. From here, you can right click the desktop and choose **Open in Terminal** . `jenny@labvm:~/Desktop$` 

## **Step 2: Explore Jenny's environment.** 

- a. Enter the **pwd** command to print the current directory, and then navigate to the **/home** directory with the **cd ../..** command. 

```
jenny@labvm:~/Desktop$ pwd
/home/jenny/Desktop
jenny@labvm:~/Desktop$ cd ../..
```

```
jenny@labvm:/home$
```

- b. Enter the **ls -l** command to list all directories in **/home** , their permissions, and their users. 

```
jenny@labvm:/home$ ls -l
```

```

```

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 joe joe 4096 Mar 19 19:44 joe
```

The Linux operating system has a total of 10 letters or dashes in the permissions fields. For example, these home directories have the following permissions: drwxr-xr-x. 

   - A **d** in the first field indicates that this is a directory. A dash ( **-** ) would mean that it is a file. 

   - The next set of three characters is for user permission ( **rwx** ). For example, the user, **jenny** , owns the directory and can **r** ead, **w** rite, and e **x** ecute the file. 

   - The second set of three characters is for group permissions ( **r-x** ). The group is **jenny** , meaning that no group, other than jenny, can write to this directory. 

   - The third set of three characters is for any other user or group permissions ( **r-x** ). Any other user or group on the computer can read or execute, but not write to the directory. 

- c. As Jenny, enter command **cd joe** to enter Joe's directory. Notice that we are able to navigate to Joe’s directory because the permission for others is **r-x** . The x allows anyone to enter the directory. 

```
jenny@labvm:/home$ cd joe
```

```
jenny@labvm:/home/joe$
```

- d. While in Joe's directory, enter the **touch new.txt** command to create a file. You are denied because user **jenny** does not have permission to write to Joe's directory. 

```
jenny@labvm:/home/joe$ touch new.txt
```

**Lab - Configure Authentication and Authorization in Linux** 

```
touch: cannot touch 'new.txt': Permission denied
```

```
jenny@labvm:/home/joe$
```

- e. Enter the **cd ..** command to exit Joe's home directory. 

```
jenny@labvm:/home/joe$ cd ..
```

```
jenny@labvm:/home$
```

## **Step 3: Login as root.** 

Joe may not want Jenny to be able to read the contents of his directory. Root access or another superuser can change the directory permissions to deny Jenny, or any other user or group, read access to Joe's home directory. 

- a. Login as user **cisco** with **password** as the password. User the **su cisco** command. 

   - `jenny@labvm:/home$` **`su cisco`** `Password:` 

- b. Enter the **sudo -i** command to switch to root and enter **password** as the password. 

   - `cisco@labvm:~$` **`sudo -i`** 

   - `[sudo] password for cisco:` **`password`** 

## **Step 4: Modify the permissions for Joe's home directory.** 

Navigate to the home directory and enter the **chmod o-x joe** command to change the permission on Joe's home directory to non-executable for other users and groups. 

```
root@labvm:~# cd /home
```

```
root@labvm:/home# chmod o-x joe
root@labvm:/home# ls -1
```

```

drwxr-xr-- 2 joe joe 4096 Mar 19 19:44
```

## **Step 5: Verify Jenny can no longer access Joe's directory.** 

- a. Logout as **root** and the user **cisco** . 

```
root@labvm:/home# exit
logout
cisco@labvm:~$ exit
logout
jenny@labvm:/home$
```

- b. Enter the **cd joe** command to attempt to navigate to Joe's directory. Notice that permission is denied. 

```
jenny@labvm:/home$ cd joe
bash: cd: joe: Permission denied
jenny@labvm:/home$
```

The chart below shows examples of other ways the **chmod** command can be used:

**Lab - Configure Authentication and Authorization in Linux** 

|**chmod command**|**Results**|
|---|---|
|**`chmod u+rwx`**|Adds read, write, and execute permissions for the user|
|**`chmod u+rw`**|Adds read and write permission for the user|
|**`chmod o+r`**|Adds read permission for others|
|**`chmod g-rwx`**|Removes read, write, and execute permissions for the group|
|_Blank Line, No additional information_||



## **Part 4: Modify Permissions in Absolute Mode** 

In the previous part, you changed permissions in symbolic mode. In symbolic mode, the administrator uses the **chmod** command with a combination of letters and symbols to add or remove permissions. In this part, you will use **chmod** command and octal values to set permissions for each triplet of permissions (rwx) for user, group, and other. 

## **Step 1: Switch user from jenny to joe.** 

- a. To switch to Joe's desktop, click **Menu** at the top left of the desktop. At the bottom of the dropdown menu, click the button with the tool tip **End the current session** . 

- b. Click **Switch User** from the dialog box. 

- c. Click **Joe** from the list of available users and enter the password **joePass** . 

- d. Joe's desktop loads. From here, you can right click the desktop and choose **Open in Terminal** . `joe@labvm:~/Desktop$` 

## **Step 2: Explore Joe's environment.** 

- a. Enter the **pwd** command to print the current directory, and then navigate to the **/home** directory with the **cd ../..** command. 

```
joe@labvm:~/Desktop$ pwd
```

- `/home/joe/Desktop` 

```
joe@labvm:~/Desktop$ cd ../..
joe@labvm:/home$
```

- b. Enter the **ls -l** command to list all directories in **/home** , their permissions, and their users. Notice that Joe’s directory is set so that “others” are not able to access it. 

```
joe@labvm:/home$ ls -l
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 2 Alice Alice 4096 Mar 18 21:58 Alice
drwxr-xr-x 2 Bob Bob 4096 Mar 18 21:58 Bob
drwxr-xr-x 12 cisco cisco 4096 Mar 19 20:02 cisco
drwxr-xr-x 2 Eric Eric 4096 Mar 18 21:58 Eric
drwxr-xr-x 2 Eve Eve 4096 Mar 18 21:58 Eve
drwxr-xr-x 9 jenny jenny 4096 Mar 20 14:02 jenny
drwxr-xr-- 9 joe joe 4096 Mar 20 15:01 joe
```

## **Step 3: Use absolute mode to modify, and then verify the permissions for Joe's directory.** 

The other way of assigning permissions besides using symbolic permissions is the use of absolute permissions. Absolute permissions use a three-digit octal number to represent the permissions for owner, group and other.

**Lab - Configure Authentication and Authorization in Linux** 

The table below outlines each absolute value and its corresponding permissions: 

|**Number**|**Permissions**|
|---|---|
|7|Read, Write, and Execute|
|6|Read and Write|
|5|Read and Execute|
|4|Read|
|3|Write and Execute|
|2|Write|
|1|Execute|
|0|None|
|_Blank Line, No additional information_||



By typing the **chmod 764 examplefile** command, the "examplefile" will be assigned the follow permissions: 

|**Digit**|**Binary Equivalent**|**Permission**|
|---|---|---|
|7 (user)|111|1-Read<br>1-Write<br>1-Execute|
|6 (group)|110|1-Read<br>1-Write<br>0-No Execute|
|4 (others)|100|1-Read<br>0-No Write<br>0-No Execute|
|_Blank Line, No additional information_|||



- a. Modify the “others” field for Joe’s folder so that others will be able read and execute but not write while still maintaining the “user” field to read, write, and execute. 

```
joe@labvm:/home$ chmod 705 joe
```

- b. List the file permissions of the current directory to see that the absolute changes were made. 

```
joe@labvm:/home$ ls -l
```
